        <div class="subheading mb-5">Valorant CoachðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I have been playing Valorant since December of 2020. I have peaked with a rank of top 3k as a duelist main and occasional initiator and sentinel. I have coached many players from various skill levels from beginners all the way to those competing at the highest level. Whether it's gunskill, strategies, or game awareness, I have been able to help players of all skill levels in at least one of these categories, if not more than one.<br><br>

        As a duelist main, I have the ability to show how to enter a site at the highest level while getting max value out of your life in order to allow for you and your team to succeed in winning rounds on offense. In turn, the idea of playing a duelist on defense is often overlooked but I have been able to maximize the effectiveness of a duelist of defense which many people ,including some of those at the pro level, can not say they do. This playstyle that I teach allows for those of all skill levels to play a duelist in a way they never knew possible which allows for you to get an advantage on the other team. 
	When it comes to playing initiator and sentinel, their main role is to enable the duelist to do their job on offense. What better way to know what a duelist needs to succeed when you know how a duelist plays. Due to my experience as a duelist main, it makes it easiest to play an initiator and sentinel on offense as the game is a team game, therefore the more in sync a team is, the more successful a team will be when trying to win the game. The ability to play off your support as a duelist is critical and as a coach of both roles, itâ€™s easier to see where the pitfalls in a player are, therefore itâ€™s easier to correct these pitfalls and create a player with sound gameplay that has the ability to properly play 3 different roles due to the understanding of how these 3 roles play off one another.
<br><br>
In order to be the best, itâ€™s necessary to think and understand how the best of the best play the game. In turn, this is where the coaching comes in as professionals donâ€™t have time to coach all the time and often will not help as they are too busy focusing on their own gameplay. What makes me different is that I donâ€™t have the opportunity to play professional as my schooling comes first but this allows me to help others achieve their goals whether it is to be a professional and make a career off of Valorant, or if it is simply to improve on the game due to having no general direction as to how to improve.
